Nice — here are **clear, step-by-step instructions** to run your Flutter app (the `FittedBox` example) **locally** in **Android Studio** or **Visual Studio Code**. I’ll cover SDK/IDE installation, project setup, assets setup (important for `Image.asset`), running on emulator or a physical device, and quick troubleshooting.

# 1 — Prerequisites (one-time)

1. Install **Flutter SDK**

   * Download and follow platform-specific steps: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
   * Unzip to a folder (example: `C:\src\flutter` on Windows or `~/development/flutter` on macOS/Linux).
   * Add `flutter/bin` to your system PATH.

2. Install **Android Studio** (for Android emulator + Gradle)

   * During install enable **Android SDK**, **Android SDK Platform**, and **Android Virtual Device**.

3. Optional: Install **Visual Studio Code** (lightweight editor)

   * Install from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

4. Verify installation:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Resolve anything `flutter doctor` flags (SDK licenses, missing SDK components, Android Studio plugin prompts).

---

# 2 — Install Flutter plugins in IDE

## Android Studio

1. Open Android Studio → **File → Settings → Plugins** (macOS: Android Studio → Preferences → Plugins).
2. Search & install **Flutter** plugin — this installs **Dart** automatically.
3. Restart Android Studio.

## VS Code

1. Open VS Code → Extensions
2. Install **Flutter** (which also installs Dart).

---

# 3 — Prepare your project files (use your code)

You already have `lib/main.dart`. Put it inside a Flutter project. You can either create a new project and replace `lib/main.dart`, or import your code into an existing Flutter project.

### Create new project (Android Studio)

* **File → New → New Flutter Project → Flutter Application**
* Point to your Flutter SDK, name the project, finish.
* Replace the generated `lib/main.dart` with your code.

### Create new project (VS Code)

* `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Flutter: New Project` → follow prompts → open created folder.
* Replace `lib/main.dart` with your code.

---

# 4 — Add the image asset (for `Image.asset('assets/laughtrh.png')`)

Your code uses `Image.asset('assets/laughtrh.png')` — you must add the file and declare it in `pubspec.yaml`.

1. In your project root create a folder named `assets` and put `laughtrh.png` inside it:

```
<project_root>/assets/laughtrh.png
```

2. Open `pubspec.yaml` and add the assets entry (ensure indentation is exact):

```yaml
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - assets/laughtrh.png
```

3. Save `pubspec.yaml` and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

> Alternate: If you prefer not to bundle the image, you can replace `Image.asset(...)` with `Image.network('https://example.com/image.png')` and no asset registration is needed.

---

# 5 — Configure an Android emulator or connect a device

## Emulator (Android Studio)

1. Android Studio → **Tools → Device Manager**
2. Create a new virtual device (e.g., Pixel 4) and download a system image (Android 11/12/13).
3. Launch the emulator.

## Physical Android device

1. Enable **Developer options** and **USB debugging** on the phone.
2. Connect via USB (allow USB debugging on device prompt).
3. Verify with:

```bash
flutter devices
```

Your emulator/device should appear in the list.

---

# 6 — Run the app

### From Android Studio

* Select the device/emulator in the top device dropdown.
* Click the **Run ▶️** button (or `Shift+F10`).
* Watch the Run console — Gradle builds and installs the APK.

### From VS Code

* Select target device at bottom-right, open `lib/main.dart`, press `F5` or `Debug → Start Debugging`.
* Or run in terminal:

```bash
flutter run
```

To run on a specific device: `flutter run -d <device_id>` (device id from `flutter devices`).

---

# 7 — Hot reload / Hot restart

* While app running, press **r** in terminal for hot reload, **R** for full restart.
* In IDE use the lightning bolt icon (hot reload).

---

# 8 — Common problems & fixes

* **Image not showing / asset error**:

  * Check `assets` path and `pubspec.yaml` indentation. Run `flutter pub get`.
  * Use `flutter clean` then `flutter run` if stubborn.

* **Gradle build fails**:

  * Open `android` folder in Android Studio and accept SDK license prompts.
  * Ensure correct `compileSdkVersion` and installed Android SDK Platform.

* **“No devices”**:

  * Start emulator or connect device with USB debugging enabled. Run `adb devices` to verify.

* **Package not found (e.g., table_calendar)**:

  * Add dependency in `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get`. Zapp/dartpad may not support external packages online; local Android Studio will.

* **Hot reload not updating assets**:

  * Hot reload may not pick up newly added assets — use **hot restart** or stop & run again.

---

# 9 — Quick command-line cheatsheet

From project root:

```bash
flutter pub get         # fetch dependencies & assets
flutter analyze         # static analysis
flutter run             # run on connected device/emulator
flutter build apk       # build release/debug APK
flutter clean           # clear build caches (helpful for weird errors)
```

---

# 10 — Final notes tailored to your code

* You used `Image.asset('assets/laughtrh.png')` — ensure the exact file exists in `assets/`.
* For better layout, you included width/height — good. Keep `FittedBox` around the `Row` if you want scaling behavior on different screens.


you have to type the program in main.dart file 

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
void main() => runApp(const MyApp());
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // It is the root widget of your application.
  const MyApp({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multiple Layout Widget',
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      theme: ThemeData(
        // This is the theme of your application.
        primarySwatch: Colors.green,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text("FittedBox Widget")),
      body: Center(
        child: FittedBox(
          fit: BoxFit.contain,
          child: Row(
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                // Replaced Image.asset with Image.network as per instructions
                // and used the provided placeholder URL.
                child: Image.asset(
                  'assets/laughtrh.png',
                  width: 100, // Added a width to the image for better layout control
                  height: 100, // Added a height to the image for better layout control
                  fit: BoxFit.cover,
                ),
              ),
              Container(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0), // Added padding for better aesthetics
                child: const Text(
                  "This is a widget",
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Increased font size for visibility
                ),
              )
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
